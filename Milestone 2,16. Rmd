flow_sample <- flow_sample %>% 
  mutate(season = case_when(
    month > 5 & month < 9 ~ "Summer",
    month > 2 & month < 6 ~ "Spring",
    (month > 0 & month < 3) | month == 12  ~ "Winter",
    month > 8 & month < 12 ~ "Autumn",

# Task 1

## Research Questions:

Here are the research questions I identified in milestone 1. I have reworked them slightly to better fit the tasks of this milestone:

1) What is the relationship between flow and season.

2) Can we accurately predict flow from month alone? 

3) What effect does month have on extreme_type?

4) What is the relationship between year and flow?

### Exploring question 1

First I will compute the range, mean, sd and variance for flow (numerical) across season (catagorical)
```{r}
group_by(flow_sample, season) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(flow), r =range(flow), sd = sd(flow), var = var(flow))
```
Now I create a graph .
```{r}
plot(x = flow_sample$season , y = flow_sample$flow, col=)
```
### Exploring question 2

I compute the range, mean, median, and sd accross month
```{r}
group_by(flow_sample, month) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(flow), r =range(flow), sd = sd(flow), var = var(flow))
```

### Exploring question 3
I compute the number of observations for `extreme_type` (catagorical)
```{r}
flow_sample %>%
  count(extreme_type)
```
Now I graph extreme and month
```{r}

```



### question 4
I will create a new (ordinal) catagorical variable called decades. 1909-2018

```{r}

flow_sample <- flow_sample %>% 
  mutate(decades = case_when(
    year > 1900 & year < 1930 ~ "1900-1929",
    year > 1929 & year < 1960 ~ "1930-1959",
    year > 1959 & year < 1990  ~ "1960-1989",
    year > 1989 & year < 2020 ~ "1990-2019",
    TRUE ~ as.character(year)
  ) %>% as.factor()
  )

```
