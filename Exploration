# Task 1


## Choose 4 data sets
After an initial pass I have selected the following data sets to explore in more detail:

1: flow_sample
2: vancouver_trees
3: cancer_sample
4: steam_games

## Bellow I explore these 3 attributes of the data sets from the datateacher package.

First I load needed packages.
```{r}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")
```
```{r}
#install.packages("datateachr")
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
```
### Now I look at some attributes of the data set flow_sample.

```{r}
glimpse(flow_sample)
```
Three attributes of flow_sample:


### Next we look at the data set vancouver_trees.


```{r}
glimpse(vancouver_trees)

```
Three attributes of vancouver_trees:

###Next we look at the data set cancer_sample

```{r}
glimpse(cancer_sample)

```
Three attributes of cancer_sample:

### Finally we explore the steam_games data set

```{r}
glimpse(steam_games)

```
Three attributes of steam_games:


## Top 2 data sets:
I am most interested in the data sets flow_sample and cancer_sample.

I am interested for reasons.

## Top Choice: Flow.

# Task 2
This is my main analysis.
```{r}
head(flow_sample)
```

Want to: 
1) Mutate a variable. 
```{r}
table(flow_sample$sym)
sum(is.na(flow_sample$sym))
```
Most of the values for sym are B. There are 119 missing values. I am going to mutate this column into the catagories B and other.
```{r}
flow_sample <- flow_sample %>% 
  select(-station_id) %>% 
  mutate(sym = ifelse(is.na(sym), "Other",
                      ifelse(sym == "B", "B", "Other")))

table(flow_sample$sym)
head(flow_sample)
```
I also removed the station id as there was only data from one station.

2)Plot distribution of flow
```{r}
ggplot(flow_sample) +
  aes(x=flow) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = "Frequency distribution of flow",
    x = "Flow",
    y = "Absolute frequency"
  )
```


3) flow vs year

```{r}
flow_sample %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(cumflow = sum(flow, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=year, y=cumflow) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(flow_sample$year)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Flow along the time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Flow"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 
```

3) flow of a particular month

```{r}
flow_sample %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(cumflow = sum(flow, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=month, y=cumflow) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(flow_sample$month)) +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative flow along the year",
    caption = "Period: 1909 to 2018",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Flow"
  ) 
```

4) boxplot frequency

```{r}
ggplot(flow_sample) +
  aes(x=sym, y=flow, fill=sym) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~sym, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of flow by sym",
    x = "Sym",
    y = "Flow"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```
