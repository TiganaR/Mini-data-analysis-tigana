# Mini-data-analysis-tigana

## What is this project?
This project is designed to help introduce us to doing data analysis.

## What files are in the project folder?
There 3 main files in this folder:
- [README.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/collaborative-group26/blob/main/README.md). This is the file that you are reading right now; it contains a description of the project and its content. 

- The [troubleshooting-1.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/collaborative-group26/blob/main/troubleshooting-1.Rmd) file. Here I explore multiple data sets before choosing my main dataset; it can be ran in Rstudio, but you can view it in github by clicking on its knitted [.md version](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/collaborative-group26/blob/main/troubleshooting-1.md).
- The [troubleshooting-2.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/collaborative-group26/blob/main/troubleshooting-2.Rmd) file. It contains the second troubleshooting exercise we fixedThis contains the bluck of the data analysis; it can be ran in Rstudio, but you can view it in github by clicking on its knitted [.md version](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/collaborative-group26/blob/main/troubleshooting-2.md).

## How to run the code
The only code that needs to be ran is in the *.Rmd* files; it can be ran using **R studio**, which will allow you to execute the lines of code.
