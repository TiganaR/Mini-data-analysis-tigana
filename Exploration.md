Mini Data Analysis
================

# Task 1

## Choose 4 data sets

After an initial pass I have selected the following data sets to explore
in more detail:

1: flow\_sample 2: vancouver\_trees 3: cancer\_sample 4: steam\_games

## Bellow I explore these 3 attributes of the data sets from the datateacher package.

First I load needed packages.

``` {r}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")
```

``` {r}
#install.packages("datateachr")
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
```

\#\#\#Now I look at some attributes of the data set flow\_sample.

``` {r}
glimpse(flow_sample)
```

Three attributes of flow\_sample:

\#\#\#Next we look at the data set vancouver\_trees.

``` {r}
glimpse(vancouver_trees)
```

Three attributes of vancouver\_trees:

\#\#\#Next we look at the data set cancer\_sample

``` {r}
glimpse(cancer_sample)
```

Three attributes of cancer\_sample:

\#\#\#Finally we explore the steam\_games data set

``` {r}
glimpse(steam_games)
```

Three attributes of steam\_games:

\#\#Top 2 data sets: I am most interested in the data sets flow\_sample
and cancer\_sample.

I am intrested

\#\#Top Choice: Flow.
